excerpt: Who is this man Abraham Lincoln? He lived at a time when the United States was a small country and Illinois was its wilderness. The land he lived in was a frontier in the 19th century and he hoped to return to it after his Presidency. He seemed like an ordinary man though I know this is not true. Here was an individual who was larger than life, a hero from my childhood memories and yet a man who lived in Illinois.

<p>Who is this man Abraham Lincoln? He lived at a time when the United States was a small country and Illinois was its wilderness. The land he lived in was a frontier in the 19th century and he hoped to return to it after his Presidency. He seemed like an ordinary man though I know this is not true. Here was an individual who was larger than life, a hero from my childhood memories and yet a man who lived in Illinois. His face spoke of someone who spent a great deal of time outdoors working hard; it appears sturdy and weathered, thoughtful, fair, and intelligent. Looking at various photos of Lincoln I sensed a distance or remoteness, but this quickly evaporated and his thoughtful gaze seemed to put me at ease when I began painting his portrait. There is always a sense of tussled hair in his pictures, a look as if he just came in from doing chores or playing with his children.</p>
